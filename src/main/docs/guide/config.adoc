All properties on the link:{apirabbit}client/ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] are available to be modified, either through configuration or a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener].

The properties that can be converted from the string values in a configuration file can be configured directly.


include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.rabbitmq.connect.SingleRabbitConnectionFactoryConfig.adoc[]

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.rabbitmq.connect.ClusterRabbitConnectionFactoryConfig.adoc[]

NOTE: Without any configuration the defaults in the link:{apirabbit}client/ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] will be used.

To configure things like the link:{apirabbit}client/impl/CredentialsProvider.html[CredentialsProvider] a bean created event listener can be registered to intercept the creation of the connection factory.

TIP: It is also possible to disable the integration entirely with `rabbitmq.enabled: false`

== Connections

It is possible to configure multiple connections to the same server, different servers, or a single connection to one of a list of servers.

One may want to configure multiple connections to the same server in order to have one or more sets of consumers to be executed on a different thread pool. Additionally, the below config could be used to connect to different servers with the same consumer executor by simply omitting the `consumer-executor` configuration option or supplying the same value.

For example:
[source,yaml]
----
rabbitmq:
    servers:
        server-a:
            host: localhost
            port: 5672
            consumer-executor: "a-pool"
        server-b:
            host: localhost
            port: 5672
            consumer-executor: "b-pool"
----

When the connection is specified in the ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.Queue[] annotation to be "server-b" for example, the "b-pool" executor service will be used to execute the consumers.

IMPORTANT: When the configuration option `rabbitmq.servers` is used, no other options underneath `rabbitmq` are read; for example `rabbitmq.uri`.

RabbitMQ also supports a fail over connection strategy where the first server that connects successfully will be used among a list of servers. To use this option in Micronaut, simply supply a list of `host:port` addresses.

[source,yaml]
----
rabbitmq:
    addresses:
      - localhost:12345
      - localhost:12346
    username: guest
    password: guest
----

NOTE: The `addresses` option can also be used with the multiple server configuration.
