=== Upgrading to Micronaut RabbitMQ 4.0

Micronaut RabbitMQ 4.0 is a significant major version which includes a number of changes you will need to consider when upgrading.

=== Micronaut 4, AMQP Java Client 5, & Java 17 baseline

Micronaut RabbitMQ 4.0 requires the following minimum set of dependencies:

* Java 17 or above
* AMQP Java Client 5 or above
* Micronaut 4 or above

=== `@Queue` annotation member `numberOfConsumers` is now a `String`

Previous versions of Micronaut RabbitMQ used an `int` for the `numberOfConsumers` setting of the `@Queue` annotation. In order to allow this value to be changed via external configuration using an expression such as `@Queue(numberOfConsumers = "$\{configured-number-of-consumers}")`, the type of `numberOfConsumers` has been changed to `String`.
