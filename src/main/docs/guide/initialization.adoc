The purpose of this library is to consume and publish messages with RabbitMQ. Any setup of queues, exchanges, or the binding between them is *not* done automatically. If your requirements dictate that your application should be creating those entities, then a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener] can be registered to intercept the api:configuration.rabbitmq.connect.ChannelPool[] to perform operations with the Java API directly. A class has been provided that you can simply extend to receive a channel to do this work.

For all of the examples in this documentation, an event listener has been registered to create the required queues, exchanges, and bindings necessary for the code to be tested.
