Client methods support two return types, `void` and a reactive type. If the method returns `void`, the message will be published and the method will return without acknowledgement. If a reactive type is the return type, a "cold" publisher will be returned that can be subscribed to.

Since the publisher is cold, the message will not actually be published until the stream is subscribed to.

For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.rabbitmq.docs.publisher.acknowledge.ProductClient[tags="imports,clazz", project-base="docs-examples/example]

<1> A `Publisher` can be returned. Any other reactive streams implementation type can also be returned given the required relevant dependency is in place
<2> Java futures can also be returned

NOTE: RxJava 1 is not supported. Publisher acknowledgements will be executed on the IO thread pool.
