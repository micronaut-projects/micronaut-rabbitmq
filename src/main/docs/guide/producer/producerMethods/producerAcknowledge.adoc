Client methods support two return types, `void` and a reactive type. If the method returns `void`, the message will be published and the method will return without acknowledgement. If a reactive type is the return type, a "cold" publisher will be returned that can be subscribed to.

Since the publisher is cold, the message will not actually be published until the stream is subscribed to.

Micronaut comes with RxJava2 by default, and the link:http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Completable.html[Completable] type is the reactive type that best fits the publisher acknowledgement use case. No value of any type is returned, the message is either acknowledged (completed) or not (error).

For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.configuration.rabbitmq.docs.publisher.acknowledge.ProductClient[tags="imports,clazz", project-base="docs-examples/example]

<1> The recommended approach of using a `Completable` as the return type for those using link:https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2].
<2> A `Maybe` also closely matches the use case of publisher acknowledgement.
<3> For those that prefer link:https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor], a `Mono` can be used. Note that Micronaut does not ship with Reactor.
<4> For those who prefer not to use any reactive library in their code, a `Publisher` can be returned.

NOTE: RxJava 1 is not supported.
