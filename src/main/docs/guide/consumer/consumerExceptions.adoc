Exceptions can occur in a number of different ways. Possible problem areas include:

* Binding the message to the method arguments
* Exceptions thrown from the consumer methods
* Exceptions as a result of message acknowledgement
* Exceptions thrown attempting to add the consumer to the channel

If the consumer bean implements api:configuration.rabbitmq.exception.RabbitListenerExceptionHandler[], then exceptions will be sent to the method implementation.

If the consumer bean does not implement api:configuration.rabbitmq.exception.RabbitListenerExceptionHandler[], then the exceptions will be routed to the primary exception handler bean. To override the default exception handler, replace the api:configuration.rabbitmq.exception.DefaultRabbitListenerExceptionHandler[] with your own implementation that is designated as `@Primary`.
