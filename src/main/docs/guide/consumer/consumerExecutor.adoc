RabbitMQ allows an link:{jdkapi}/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html[ExecutorService] to be supplied for new connections. The service is used to execute consumers. A single connection is used for the entire application and it is configured to use the `consumer` named executor service. The executor can be configured through application configuration. See link:{apimicronaut}scheduling/executor/ExecutorConfiguration.html[ExecutorConfiguration] for the full list of options.

For example:

.Configuring the `consumer` thread pool
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    executors:
        consumer:
            type: fixed
            nThreads: 25
----

If no configuration is supplied, a fixed thread pool with 2 times the amount of available processors is used.
