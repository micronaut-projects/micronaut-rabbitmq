The arguments passed to link:{apirabbit}client/Channel.html#basicConsume(java.lang.String,boolean,java.lang.String,boolean,boolean,java.util.Map,com.rabbitmq.client.Consumer)[basicConsume] can be configured through the ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.RabbitProperty[] annotation.

In addition, any method parameters can be annotated to bind to properties from the link:{apirabbit}client/BasicProperties.html[BasicProperties] received with the message.

<1> The property is sent as an argument to the Java client consume method. Properties could also be defined on the class level to apply to all consumers in the class. Note the type is required here if RabbitMQ expects something other than a `String`.
<2> The argument is bound from the `userId` property.
<3> The property name to bind from is inferred from the argument name. This argument allows null values.
<4> If the argument name matches one of the defined property names, it will be bound from that property.

IMPORTANT: If the annotation or argument name cannot be matched to a property name, an exception will be thrown. If the supplied type cannot be converted from the type defined in link:{apirabbit}client/BasicProperties.html[BasicProperties], an exception will be thrown.
