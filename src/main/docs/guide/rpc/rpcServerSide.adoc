The "server side" in this case starts with the consumption of a message, and then a new message is published to the reply to queue.

snippet::io.micronaut.rabbitmq.docs.rpc.ProductListener[tags="imports,clazz", project-base="docs-examples/example"]

<1> The reply to property is injected. If the consumer will not always be participating in RPC this could be annotated with `@Nullable` to allow both use cases.
<2> The channel is injected so it can be used. This could be replaced with a method call of another `@RabbitClient`.
<3> The converted message is published to the `replyTo` binding.

NOTE: If the reply publish fails for any reason, the original message will be rejected.

IMPORTANT: RPC consumer methods must never return a reactive type. Because the resulting publish needs to occur on the same thread and only a single item can be emitted, there is no value in doing so.
